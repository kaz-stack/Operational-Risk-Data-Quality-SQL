# Operational Risk Data Quality â€“ SQL Project

This project demonstrates **Operational Risk Data Quality checks** using **SQLite**.  
We simulate a small operational risk events table with some intentional data issues,  
then run SQL queries to detect problems in **completeness, accuracy, validity, consistency, and timeliness**.
