# Operational Risk Data Quality ‚Äì SQL Project

This project demonstrates **Operational Risk Data Quality checks** using **SQLite**.  
We simulate a small operational risk events table with some intentional data issues,  
then run SQL queries to detect problems in **completeness, accuracy, validity, consistency, and timeliness**.

### üìå Sample Data

<div style="overflow-x: auto;">

| event_id | event_date | business_line     | branch_location | risk_category       | loss_amount | status   | reported_date |
|----------|------------|-------------------|-----------------|---------------------|-------------|----------|---------------|
| 1        | 2024-01-05 | Retail Banking    | New York        | Fraud               | 1500.00     | Open     | 2024-01-06    |
| 2        | 2024-01-07 | Corporate Banking | NULL            | System Failure      | 2500.00     | Closed   | 2024-01-10    |
| 3        | 2024-01-08 | Retail Banking    | Chicago         | Fraud               | -500.00     | Open     | 2024-01-09    |
| 4        | 2024-01-10 | Retail Banking    | Los Angeles     | InvalidCategory     | 1000.00     | Closed   | 2024-01-12    |
| 5        | 2024-01-10 | Retail Banking    | New York        | Fraud               | 1200.00     | Open     | 2024-01-25    |
| 6        | 2024-01-10 | Retail Banking    | New York        | Fraud               | 1200.00     | Open     | 2024-01-25    |

## ‚ùì Why This Project Exists

Operational risk data often contains inconsistencies, missing values, or delayed reporting,  
which can lead to **poor decision-making, regulatory issues, and financial loss**.  

This project exists to **demonstrate how to detect and address common data quality problems**  
in an operational risk dataset using SQL.  

By simulating realistic data issues ‚Äî such as missing branch locations, invalid categories,  
duplicate records, and late reporting ‚Äî the project helps learners and professionals:

- Understand key **data quality dimensions** (completeness, accuracy, validity, consistency, timeliness)
- Practice writing **SQL queries** to find and investigate data issues
- Build habits for **data quality checks** before analytics or reporting
